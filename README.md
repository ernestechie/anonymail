# AnonyMaail - Private texting platform


## About AnonyMail

This app was inspired by Kubool, gdpd.xyz. In this app you can register, generate a messaging link, send the link to your friends and get anonymous messages from them without knowing the identity of the senders.

You can also see the time it was sent, and messages are arranged in order of the time they were sent. You can also screenshot individual messages and have them saved on your device. It's a fun app.

App has automatic reload on save

#### `npm run build`

It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run eject`
