App has automatic reload on save

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
